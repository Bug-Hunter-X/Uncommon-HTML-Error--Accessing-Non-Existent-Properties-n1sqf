This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML that can be difficult to track down.  The error involves attempting to access a property of an HTML element that does not exist.  This doesn't result in an immediate error message, but can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues. The solution shows how to robustly handle potential errors by adding checks to avoid accessing missing properties.
